My name is Mehrshad Hassanzadeh.
I made a simple project with an animation and photos that it's about Scanning and Authenticate.
I use html, Css and,I want to a little explain it.
HTML: The Backbone of the Web
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language for creating web pages. It's like the skeleton of a website, defining the structure and content. While it might seem complex, HTML is actually quite straightforward.

Think of an HTML document as a text file containing special tags. These tags, enclosed in angle brackets (<>), tell the web browser how to display the content. For example, the <p> tag defines a paragraph, while <h1> to <h6> define headings of different importance. Images are inserted using the <img> tag, and links are created with the <a> tag.

A basic HTML structure consists of:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type.
<html>: The root element of an HTML page.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the page, like title and stylesheets.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the page.
HTML is not just about structure; it's also about semantics. This means using appropriate tags to convey the meaning of content. For instance, using <strong> for important text and <em> for emphasized text.
While HTML is powerful on its own, it's often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling. Together, these technologies create dynamic and engaging web experiences.
In essence, HTML is the cornerstone of web development. By understanding its basic structure and tags, you can create the foundation for any website.

CSS: The Stylist of the Web
While HTML provides the structure of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style it. Think of CSS as the makeup artist for your website, adding color, fonts, layout, and visual appeal.  
CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements. These rules define how elements should look on different devices and screen sizes. For instance, you can specify font size, color, background, and positioning.  
A basic CSS rule consists of a selector, a property, and a value:

CSS
selector {
  property: value;
}

For example, to change the color of all headings to blue:

CSS
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: blue;
}

body of work:
body {
    display: ....;
    justify-content: ....;
    align-items: ....;
    min-height: ....;
    background: ....;
}

CSS offers a wide range of possibilities. You can create complex layouts using techniques like flexbox and grid, design responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes, and even create animations.
CSS also supports inheritance, meaning styles can be passed down from parent elements to child elements. This makes it efficient to apply styles to multiple elements at once.
By combining HTML and CSS, you can transform a plain text document into a visually stunning and user-friendly website. It's the perfect complement to HTML, allowing you to create websites that not only function well but also look great.
